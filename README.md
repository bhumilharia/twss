Edit:
I've forked this to implement the classification based on bigrams, and to test the results against the current unigram-based classification.

Original README:

TWSS
====

This is an implementation of a simple double entendre classifier in Python. 

This currently uses a Naive Bayes classifier (the NLTK implementation), a simple SocketServer server implementation, so you can fire her up and build your own client to interact with her using basic sockets; and the bvandenbos data corpus. We might build a better API in the future. There is a sample PHP client included. 

A live version of this can be found at http://kt4.in/twss

[Ranjeet](https://twitter.com/iMayavi) and I wrote this in 3 hours on the eve of [Barcamp Mumbai](http://barcampmumbai.org) 8 and presented it there. This was fairly well received. 

Suggestions welcome. Do file bugs. Fork away. Send us pull requests.
